            The R = MC<sup>2</sup> approach

         organizational willingness (i.e., motivation) and ability
         (i.e., capacity) for readiness to implement something new
         with quality. Generally, we define an innovation as a program,
         practice, policy or process that is new to a setting.
         Readiness work can also be applied to current interventions
         by simply substituting the word innovation with intervention.

        <p>
          There are psychological aspects of any change effort that are
          important for implementation success. Motivation consists of
          features of an innovation that contribute to whether people
          want to do it.

        <p>
          General capacities are the conditions applicable for any
          innovation. These are the overall organizational

          Innovation-specific capacities are the conditions that
          are necessary to implement a particular innovation. This
          includes not only the knowledge and skills for the innovation,
          but the conditions within the organization that facilitate
          implementation.

                Readiness is more than being "ready or not." Rather,
                readiness is determined by the three related components
                that can vary in influence depending on the setting.
                Each component has a number of subcomponents that
                provide more detail about motivation and capacity.

                When considering using readiness in a setting, consider
                this question: What are we ready for? Conditions may be
                right for one innovation while not being right for another.
                For example, just because a community coalition is motivated
                to implement a community walking program does not mean that
                they are ready to implement a nutrition program, even though
                they are both related to health and wellness. Therefore, it
                is necessary to specify the innovation to apply the readiness
                concepts.

                of achieving good outcomes. Furthermore, these conditions
                can be preventively addressed to promote the sustainability
                of implementation so that gains are maintained and drift in
                quality in minimized. By knowing the readiness of an
                organization, a readiness building plan can be developed
                to increase motivation and capacity.
